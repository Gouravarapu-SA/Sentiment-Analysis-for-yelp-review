# Machine Learning Project: Yelp Review Classification

This Jupyter notebook contains code for a machine learning project using the Yelp review dataset.

## Overview

The notebook performs the following steps:

1. Imports necessary packages for data manipulation, machine learning, visualization, etc.
2. Loads the Yelp review dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
3. Performs some initial data cleaning and feature engineering.
4. Explores the dataset and does some basic analysis and visualizations.
5. Splits the data into train and test sets for model training and evaluation.
6. Implements text preprocessing and vectorization techniques on the review text data.
7. Trains and evaluates various machine learning classification models like Naive Bayes, Random Forest, etc., on the vectorized text features.
8. Analyzes the performance of different models using various metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

## Requirements

The code is written in Python and requires the following packages:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- WordCloud

## Usage

I. Install the requirements listed above.

II. Download the Yelp review dataset CSV file.

III. Update the file path in cell 3 to point to the CSV file.

IV. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

V. Tweak parameters and models as desired.

VI. Additional comments are provided within the notebook.
