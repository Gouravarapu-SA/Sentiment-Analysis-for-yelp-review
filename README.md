# Sentiment-Analysis-for-yelp-review
This Jupyter notebook contains code for machine learning project using the Yelp review dataset.

##OVERVIEW:
The notebook performs the following steps:

1. Imports necessary packages for data manipulation, machine learning, visualization etc.

2. Loads the Yelp review dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.

3. Performs some initial data cleaning and feature engineering.

4. Explores the dataset and does some basic analysis and visualizations.

5. Splits the data into train and test sets for model training and evaluation.

6. Implements some text preprocessing and vectorization techniques on the review text data.

7. Trains and evaluates various machine learning classification models like Naive Bayes, Random Forest etc. on the vectorized text features.

8. Analyzes the performance of different models using various metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix etc.

##REQUIREMENTS:
The code is written in Python and requires the following packages:

* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
